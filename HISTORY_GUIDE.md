### 6. **Efficiency Metrics** ⚡

Two key rankings:

Teams that win MORE than their scoring suggests:
- Top 5 teams
- Efficiency % (>100% = overachieving)
- Record and PPG shown

**Example:**
```
#1 Team Charlie
8-4 • 102.3 PPG
Efficiency: 125.4%
```
*Translation: Wins 25% more than expected based on scoring*

#### **Most Unlucky** 😭
Teams that win LESS than their scoring suggests:
- Bottom 5 teams
- Low efficiency % (<100% = underachieving)
- Record and PPG shown

**Example:**
```
#1 Team Delta
4-8 • 118.7 PPG
Efficiency: 68.2%
```
*Translation: Scoring well but losing games (bad luck)*

---

## 🎯 What Each Metric Means

### **Efficiency Score**

**Formula:** `Actual Win% ÷ Expected Win%`

**Expected Win% based on:**
- Above average PPG → 60% expected
- Below average PPG → 40% expected

**Interpretation:**
- **>120%** = Extremely lucky/clutch
- **100-120%** = Slightly overperforming
- **80-100%** = Slight underperforming
- **<80%** = Very unlucky

**Why it matters:**
Shows if your record matches your talent level or if you're getting lucky/unlucky breaks.

---

### **Win Percentage Categories**

| Win % | Rating | Color |
|-------|--------|-------|
| ≥60% | Elite | Green |
| 50-60% | Good | Blue |
| 40-50% | Average | Gray |
| <40% | Poor | Red |
